title: Diego Architecture
---

This topic provides an overview of the high-level structure of Diego, the next-generation container management system for Cloud Foundry (CF). 

* To deploy Diego, see the GitHub [Diego-Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release).
* For more information about the major components of Diego and how they interact with other Cloud Foundry components, see the [Diego Components](./diego-components.html) topic.

##<a id='overview'></a>Overview

In a Cloud Foundry deployment without Diego, the [Cloud Controller](../architecture/cloud-controller.html) schedules and manages applications on the [Droplet Execution Agents](../architecture/execution-agent.html) (DEAs). Diego replaces the DEAs and the [Health Manager](../architecture/index.html#hm9k), and assumes application scheduling and management responsibility from the Cloud Controller.

Refer to the diagram and descriptions below for information about the way Diego handles application requests.

1. The Cloud Controller passes requests to stage and run applications to [CC-Bridge](./diego-components.html#bridge-components).

1. CC-Bridge translates staging and running requests into [Tasks and Long Running Processes](./diego-auction.html#processes) (LRPs), then  submits these to the [Bulletin Board System](./diego-components.html#bbs) (BBS) through an RPC-style API over HTTP. 

1. The BBS submits the Tasks and LRPs to the [Auctioneer](./diego-components.html#auctioneer). 

1. The Auctioneer distributes these Tasks and LRPs to [Cells](./diego-components.html#cell-components) through an Auction.

1. Once the Auctioneer assigns a Task or LRP to a Cell, an in-process [Executor](./diego-components.html#executor) creates a [Garden](./diego-components.html#garden) container in the Cell. The Task or LRP runs in the container.

1. The BBS also tracks desired LRPs, running LRP instances, and in-flight Tasks for the [Converger](./diego-components.html#converger). The Converger periodically analyzes this information and corrects discrepancies, ensuring that Diego is eventually consistent.

1. [Metron Agents](./diego-components.html#metron-agent) forward application logs, errors, and application and Diego metrics to the [Loggregator](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator) Doppler component.
 
## <a id='monitoring'></a>Monitoring and Testing

You can monitor and test runtime deployment using the following releases:

###Inigo

Inigo is an integration test suite that launches the Diego components through various test cases, including component failures and other exceptional scenarios. Inigo validates a given set of component versions to ensure mutual compatibility, robustness, and that in failure conditions performance degrades gracefully.

Refer to the [Inigo repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/inigo) on GitHub for more information.

###Auction

Diego allocates Tasks and LRPs to the executing cells using the [Diego Auction](./diego-auction.html). 

The Auction package encodes behavioral details for the Diego Auction. It includes a simulation test suite that validates the optimal performance of the auction algorithm. You can run the simulation for different algorithm variants at various scales, and in the following ways:

- In-process, for quick feedback loops

- Across multiple processes, to reveal the impact of communication in the auction

- Across multiple machines in a cloud-like infrastructure, to reveal the impact of latency on the auction

Refer to the [Auction repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/inigo) on GitHub for more information.

###Diego Acceptance Tests

Diego Acceptance Tests (DAT) is a suite of acceptance-level tests that run against Cloud Foundry and Diego deployment releases. The purpose of DAT is to execute a number of "happy-path" test cases across an entire deployment.

Refer to the [Diego Acceptance Test  repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-acceptance-tests) on GitHub for more information.
