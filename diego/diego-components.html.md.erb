This topic describes the components that make up the Diego container management system for Cloud Foundry (CF).

For an overview of the high-level structure of Diego, see the [Diego Architecture](./diego-architecture.html) topic.

The diagram below illustrates the primary Diego components and how they interact with other Cloud Foundry components.

##<a id='core'></a>Diego Core Components##

Components in the Diego core run and monitor [Tasks](./diego-auction.html#task) and [Long Running Processes](./diego-auction.html#processes) (LRPs). The core consists of the following major areas:

* [Brain](#brain-components)
* [Cells](#cell-components)
* [Database VMs](#database-vms)
* [Access VMs](#access-vms)
* [Consul](#consul)

###<a id='brain-components'></a>Diego Brain ###

Diego Brain components distribute Tasks and LRPs to Diego [Cells](#cell-components), and correct discrepancies between `ActualLRP` and `DesiredLRP` counts to ensure fault-tolerance and long-term consistency. The Diego Brain consists of the [Auctioneer](#auctioneer) and the [Converger](#converger).

<a id='auctioneer'></a>

####Auctioneer ####

- Uses the [auction package](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/auction) to run [Diego Auctions](./diego-auction.html) for Tasks and LRPs

- Communicates with Cell [Reps](#rep) over HTTP

- Maintains a lock in the [BBS](#bbs) that restricts auctions to one Auctioneer at a time

Refer to the [Auctioneer repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/auctioneer) on GitHub for more information.

####<a id='converger'></a>Converger ####

- Uses converge methods from the [Runtime Schema](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/runtime-schema) to analyze snapshots from the [BBS](#bbs) to ensure consistency and fault tolerance for Tasks and LRPs

- Acts to keep `DesiredLRP` count and `ActualLRP` count synchronized in the following ways:
    - If the `DesiredLRP` count exceeds the `ActualLRP` count, the Converger requests a start auction from the [Auctioneer](#auctioneer)
    - If the `ActualLRP` count exceeds the `DesiredLRP` count, the Converger sends a stop message to the [Rep](#rep) on the [Cell](#cell-components) hosting an instance

- Monitors for potentially missed messages, resending them if necessary

- Maintains a lock in the [BBS](#bbs) that limits converge methods to one Converger at a time

Refer to the [Converger repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/converger) on GitHub for more information.

###<a id='database-vms'></a>Database VMs ###


####<a id='bbs'></a>Diego Bulletin Board System ####

####<a id='file-server'></a>File Server ####

- Serves static assets used by various Diego components, particularly the [App Lifecycle binaries](#app-lifecycles)

Refer to the [File Server repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/file-server) on GitHub for more information.


####<a id='ssh-proxy'></a>SSH Proxy ####

- Brokers connections between SSH clients and SSH servers running inside instance containers

Refer to the [Diego SSH concept document](./ssh-conceptual.html), [the Diego SSH procedural overview](../../devguide/deploy-apps/app-ssh-overview.html), or the [Diego SSH Github repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-ssh) for more information.

---

###<a id='consul'></a>Consul ###

- Provides dynamic service registration and load balancing through DNS resolution

- Provides a consistent key-value store for maintenance of distributed locks and component presence

Refer to the [Consul repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul) on GitHub for more information.


####<a id='consuladapter'></a>Consuladapter ####

Consuladapter provides a driver for interfacing with etcd.

Refer to the [Consuladapter repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/consuladapter) on GitHub for more information.

##<a id='bridge-components'></a>Cloud Controller Bridge Components ##

The Cloud Controller Bridge (CC-Bridge) components translate app-specific requests from the Cloud Controller to the BBS. These components include the following:


###<a id='stager'></a>Stager ###

- Translates staging requests from the Cloud Controller into generic Tasks and LRPs

- Sends a response to the Cloud Controller when a Task completes

Refer to the [Stager repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stager) on GitHub for more information.


###<a id='cc-uploader'></a>CC-Uploader ###

- Mediates uploads from the [Executor](#executor) to the Cloud Controller

- Translates simple HTTP POST requests from the Executor into complex multipart-form uploads for the Cloud Controller

Refer to the [CC-Uploader repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cc-uploader) on GitHub for more information.

###<a id='nsync'></a>Nsync ###

- Listens for app requests to update the `DesiredLRPs` count and updates `DesiredLRPs` through the BBS

- Periodically polls the Cloud Controller for each app to ensure that Diego maintains accurate `DesiredLRPs` counts

Refer to the [Nsync repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/nsync) on GitHub for more information.

###<a id='tps'></a>TPS ###

- Provides the Cloud Controller with information about currently running LRPs to respond to `cf apps` and `cf app APP_NAME` requests

- Monitors `ActualLRP` activity for crashes and reports them the Cloud Controller

Refer to the [TPS repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/tps) on GitHub for more information.

##<a id='platform-specific'></a>Platform-specific Components ##

###<a id='backends'></a>Garden Backends ###

Garden contains a set of interfaces that each platform-specific backend must implement. These interfaces contain methods to perform the following actions:

- Create and delete containers
- Apply resource limits to containers
- Open and attach network ports to containers
- Copy files into and out of containers
- Run processes within containers
- Stream `STDOUT` and `STDERR` data out of containers
- Annotate containers with arbitrary metadata
- Snapshot containers for redeploys without downtime

Refer to the [Garden repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden) on GitHub for more information.

####<a id='backend-implementations'></a>Current Implementations ####

- [Garden-Linux](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux) provides a Linux-specific implementation of a Garden interface.

###<a id='app-lifecycles'></a>App Lifecycles ###

App Lifecycles implement deployment strategies. Each App Lifecycle contains the following three binaries:

- The **Builder**, which stages a CF application. The [CC-Bridge](#bridge-components) runs the Builder as a Task on every staging request. The Builder performs static analysis on the application code and does any necessary pre-processing before the application is first run.

- The **Launcher**, which runs a CF application. The [CC-Bridge](#bridge-components) sets the Launcher as the Action on the `DesiredLRP` for the application. The Launcher executes the start command with the correct system context, including working directory and environment variables.

- The **Healthcheck**, which performs a status check on running CF application from inside the container. The [CC-Bridge](#bridge-components) sets the Healthcheck as the Monitor action on the `DesiredLRP` for the application.


####<a id='lifecycle-implementations'></a>Current Implementations ####

- [Buildpack App Lifecycle](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/buildpack-app-lifecycle) implements the Cloud Foundry buildpack-based deployment strategy.

- [Docker App Lifecycle](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/docker-app-lifecycle) implements a Docker deployment strategy.

##<a id='other-components'></a>Other Components ##

###<a id='route-emitter'></a>Route-Emitter ###

- Monitors `DesiredLRP` and `ActualLRP` states, emitting route registration and unregistration messages to the Cloud Foundry  [router](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter) when it detects changes

- Periodically emits the entire routing table to the Cloud Foundry router

Refer to the [Route-Emitter repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/route-emitter) on GitHub for more information.
