title: (Go)Router
---

The router routes traffic coming into Cloud Foundry to the appropriate component: usually, [Cloud Controller](./cloud-controller.html) or a running application on a [DEA](./execution-agent.html) node. The router is implemented in Go.
Implementing a custom router in Go gives the router full control over every connection, which makes it easier to support WebSockets and other types of traffic (for example, via HTTP CONNECT). A single process contains all routing logic, removing unnecessary latency.

# Getting started

Refer to the following instructions for help getting started with the gorouter in a standalone environment.

## Setup

<pre class="terminal">
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter.git
$ cd gorouter
$ git submodule update --init
$ ./bin/go install router/router
$ gem install nats
</pre>

## Start

<pre class="terminal">
# Start NATS server in daemon mode
$ nats-server -d

# Start gorouter
$ ./bin/router
</pre>

## Usage

Gorouter receives route updates via [NATS](./messaging-nats.html). By default, routes that have not been updated in two minutes are pruned. Therefore, to maintain an active route, ensure that the route is updated at least every two minutes. The format of these route updates is as follows:

~~~json
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 4567,
  "uris": [
    "my_first_url.vcap.me",
    "my_second_url.vcap.me"
  ],
  "tags": {
    "another_key": "another_value",
    "some_key": "some_value"
  }
}
~~~

Such a message can be sent to both the `router.register` subject to register URIs, and to the `router.unregister` subject to unregister URIs, respectively.

<pre class="terminal">
$ nohup ruby -rsinatra -e 'get("/") { "Hello!" }' &
$ nats-pub 'router.register' '{"host":"127.0.0.1","port":4567,
	"uris":["my_first_url.vcap.me","my_second_url.vcap.me"],
	"tags":{"another_key":"another_value","some_key":"some_value"}}'
Published [router.register] : '{"host":"127.0.0.1","port":4567,
	"uris":["my_first_url.vcap.me","my_second_url.vcap.me"],
	"tags":{"another_key":"another_value","some_key":"some_value"}}'
$ curl my_first_url.vcap.me:8080
Hello!
</pre>

## Instrumentation

Gorouter provides `/varz` and `/healthz` http endpoints for monitoring.

The `/routes` endpoint returns the entire routing table as JSON. Each route has an associated array of `host:port` entries.

All of the endpoints require http basic authentication, credentials for which you can acquire through NATS. You can explicitly set the `port`, `user` and password (`pass` is the config attribute) in the gorouter.yml config file `status` section.

~~~yaml
status:
  port: 8080
  user: some_user
  pass: some_password
~~~

Example interaction with `curl`:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -vvv "http://someuser:somepass@127.0.0.1:8080/routes"
* About to connect() to 127.0.0.1 port 8080 (#0)
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* connected
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
