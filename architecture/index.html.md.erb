title: Cloud Foundry Components
---

Cloud Foundry components include a self-service application execution engine, an
automation engine for application deployment and lifecycle management, and a
scriptable command line interface (CLI), as well as integration with development
tools to ease deployment processes.
Cloud Foundry has an open architecture that includes a buildpack mechanism for
adding frameworks, an application services interface, and a cloud provider
interface.

Refer to the descriptions below for more information about Cloud Foundry
components.
Some descriptions include links to more detailed documentation.

![Cloud Foundry Architecture](../images/cf_architecture_block.png)

## <a id='router'></a>Router ##

The [router](./router.html) routes incoming traffic to the appropriate
component, usually the Cloud Controller or a running application on a DEA node.

## <a id='uaa'></a> Authentication ##

The OAuth2 server (the [UAA](./uaa.html)) and Login Server work together to
provide identity management.

## <a id='cc'></a> Cloud Controller ##

The [Cloud Controller](./cloud-controller.html) is responsible for managing the
lifecycle of applications.
When a developer pushes an application to Cloud Foundry, she is targeting the
Cloud Controller.
The Cloud Controller then stores the raw application bits, creates a record to
track the application metadata, and directs a DEA node to stage and run the
application.
The Cloud Controller also maintains records of orgs, spaces, services,
service instances, user roles, and more.

## <a id='hm9k'></a> HM9000 ##

HM9000 has four core responsibilities:

* Monitor applications to determine their state (e.g. running, stopped, crashed, etc.), version, and number of instances.  HM9000 updates the actual state of an application based on heartbeats and `droplet.exited` messages issued by the DEA running the application.
* Determine applications' expected state, version, and number of instances. HM9000 obtains the desired state of an application from a dump of the Cloud Controller database.
* Reconcile the actual state of applications with their expected state. For instance, if fewer than expected instances are running, HM9000 will instruct the Cloud Controller to start the appropriate number of instances.
* Direct Cloud Controller to take action to correct any discrepancies in the state of applications.

HM9000 is essential to ensuring that apps running on Cloud Foundry remain
available.
HM9000 restarts applications whenever the DEA running an app shuts down for any
reason, when Warden kills the app because it violated a quota, or when the
application process exits with a non-zero exit code.

Refer to the [HM9000 readme](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/hm9000) for more
information about the HM9000 architecture.

## <a id='dea'></a> Application Execution (DEA) ##

The [Droplet Execution Agent](./execution-agent.html) manages application
instances, tracks started instances, and broadcasts state messages.

Application instances live inside [Warden](./warden.html) containers.
Containerization ensures that application instances run in isolation, get their
fair share of resources, and are protected from noisy neighbors.

## <a id='blob'></a> Blob Store ##

The blob store holds:

* Application code
* Buildpacks
* Droplets

## <a id='broker'></a> Service Brokers ##

Applications typically depend on <%= vars.services %> such as databases
or third-party SaaS providers.
When a developer provisions and binds a service to an application, the service
broker for that service is responsible for providing the service instance.

## <a id='nats'></a> Message Bus ##

Cloud Foundry uses [NATS](./messaging-nats.html), a lightweight
publish-subscribe and distributed queueing messaging system, for internal
communication between components.

## <a id='metrics'></a> Logging and Statistics ##

The metrics collector gather metrics from the components.
Operators can use this information to monitor an instance of Cloud Foundry.

The application log aggregator streams application logs to developers.
