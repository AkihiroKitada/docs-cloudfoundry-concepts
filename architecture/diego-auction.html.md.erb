title: How Diego Allocates Work
---

The Diego Auction is the process by which Diego allocates tasks and long running processes (LRPs) to cells, which will execute them. The auction replaces the [Cloud Controller DEA placement algorithm](./cloud-controller.html#dea-placement), which performed this function in the pre-Diego Cloud Foundry architecture.
