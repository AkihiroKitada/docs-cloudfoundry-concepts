<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

<%= vars.product_name %> uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to grant <%=vars.product_full %> users permissions appropriate to their role within an org or a space. This topic describes how orgs and spaces work within a <%= vars.product_name %> deployment, and how different <%=vars.product_full %> User roles operate within those contexts.

Admins, <%= vars.product_name %>, Org Managers, and Space Managers can assign user roles using the [cf CLI](../cf-cli/getting-started.html#user-roles)<%= vars.or_apps_man %>.

## <a id='orgs'></a>Orgs ##

An org is a development account that an individual or multiple collaborators
can own and use.
All collaborators access an org with user accounts.
Collaborators in an org share a resource quota plan, applications, services
availability, and custom domains.

## <a id='users'></a>User Accounts ##

A user account represents an individual person within the context of a Cloud
Foundry installation.
A user can have different roles in different spaces within an org, governing
what level and type of access they have within that space.

## <a id='spaces'></a>Spaces ##

Every application and service is scoped to a space.
Each org contains at least one space.
A space provides users with access to a shared location for application
development, deployment, and maintenance.
Each space role applies only to a particular space.

## <a id='roles'></a>Roles and Permissions ##

A user can have one or more roles.
The combination of these roles defines the userâ€™s overall permissions in the
org and within specific spaces in that org.


* **Org Managers** are managers or other users who need to administer the account.

    <%= vars.link_adminguide_commands %>

* **Org Auditors** view but cannot edit user information and org quota usage 
information.

* **Org Billing Managers** create and manage billing account and payment
information.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Billing Manager role is only relevant for Cloud Foundry environments deployed with a billing engine.</p>

* **Space Managers** are managers or other users who administer a space within an org.

* **Space Developers** are application developers or other users who manage 
applications and services in a space.

* **Space Auditors** view but cannot edit the space.
