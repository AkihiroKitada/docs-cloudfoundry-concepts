To enable validation of app instance identity, follow these steps:

1. Configure the Gorouter to initiate a TLS handshake to back ends that require it. See instructions at [TLS to Apps and Other Back-End Services](#tls-to-back-end). Note: `router.ca_certs` should include the CA certificate used to sign the certificate configured in `diego.executor.instance_identity_ca_cert`.
- Configure Diego to run a proxy in each container with the following manifest property:
  - `containers.proxy.enabled: true`: This proxy will be used to terminate TLS for requests from Gorouter and present the App Instance certificate in the handshake.<br><br>

You can configure the above properties for both Gorouter and Diego by using [this ops file](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/v1.6.0/operations/experimental/enable-routing-integrity.yml) with your [cf-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment) manifest.
