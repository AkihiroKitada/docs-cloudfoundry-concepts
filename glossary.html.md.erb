| Term          | Definition   |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| API           | Application Programming Interface |
| BOSH          | BOSH is an open framework for managing the full development and deployment life cycle of large-scale distributed software applications. |
| CLI           | Command Line Interface |
| DEA           | Droplet Execution Agent. The DEA is the component in <%=vars.product_short%> responsible for staging and hosting applications. |
| Domains       | A domain is a domain name like `<%=vars.app_domain%>`. Domains can also be multi-level and contain sub-domains like the "myapp" in `myapp.<%=vars.app_domain%>`. Domain objects belong to an org and are not directly bound to apps. |
| Droplet       | An archive within <%=vars.product_short%> that contains the application ready to run on a DEA. A droplet is the result of the application staging process. |
| Management    | You can manage spaces and orgs with the cf command line interface, the Cloud Controller API, and the Cloud Foundry Eclipse Plugin. |
| Ops Manager or Operations Manager	| Operations Manager is a web application that you use to deploy and manage a Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; PaaS. |
| Org | An org is the top-most meta object within the <%=vars.product_short%> infrastructure. Only an account with administrative privileges on a <%=vars.product_short%> instance can manage its orgs. |
| Routes        | A route, based on a domain with an optional host as a prefix, may be associated with one or more applications. For example, `myapp` is the host and `<%=vars.app_domain%>` is the domain when using the route `myapp.<%=vars.app_domain%>`. It is possible to have a route that represents `<%=vars.app_domain%>` without a host. Routes are children of domains and are directly bound to apps. |
| Service       | A "factory" which produces service instances. |
| Service Instance | A reserved resource provisioned by a service. The resource provisioned will differ by service; could be a database or an account on a multi-tenant application. |
| Spaces        | An org can contain multiple spaces. You can map a domain to multiple spaces, but you can map a route to only one space. |
| Staging       | The process in <%=vars.product_short%> by which the raw bits of an application are transformed into a droplet that is ready to execute. |
| Warden        | The mechanism for containerization on DEAs that ensures applications running on <%=vars.product_short%> have a fair share of computing resources and cannot access either the system code or other applications running on the DEA. |
