title: Cloud Foundry Concepts
---

Cloud Foundry is an open platform as a service, providing a choice of clouds, developer frameworks, and application services. Cloud Foundry makes it faster and easier to build, test, deploy and scale applications. It is an [open source project](https://github.com/cloudfoundry) and is available through a variety of private cloud distributions and public cloud instances.

This guide presents an overview of how Cloud Foundry works, a discussion of key concepts, and a glossary of terms. Refer to this guide to learn more about Cloud Foundry fundamentals.
