#### <a id='always-forward'></a>Always Forward Headers

By default, CF forwards arbitrary headers that are not otherwise mentioned in the docs, and a load balancer can be configured to put the certificate of the originating client, received during the mutual TLS handshake, into an HTTP header that the load balancer forwards upstream. We recommend the header `X-Forwarded-Client-Cert` for this use case, as this header is used in other configuration modes described below. The value of the header should be the base64 encoded bytes of the certificate; equivalent to a PEM file with newlines, headers, and footers removed.

This mode is enabled by default or when <code>router.forwarded\_client\_cert: always\_forward</code>.
