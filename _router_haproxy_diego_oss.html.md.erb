The Gorouter and HAProxy trust the Diego intermediate certificate authority. 
This trust enables mutual authentication between applications that are running on Cloud Foundry. 
Operators should configure the Gorouter with the root certificate authority by editing their `manifest.yml` to include the `router.ca_certs` manifest property within the Gorouter job.

router:
	ca_certs:

<%= partial '/pcf/deprecation-notice' %>--BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
	    (contents of certificate)
	    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
</pre>

The `router.ca_certs` property is a string of concatenated certificate authorities in PEM format. 

This manifest property is used to sign the Diego intermediate certificate authority. 
In turn, the Diego intermediate certificate authority is used to sign the instance credentials.
These signatures enable applications to present instance credentials in a TLS handshake with the Gorouter when being authenticated by other applications.
